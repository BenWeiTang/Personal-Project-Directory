## [(WIP) Real Time Music Visualization | C++ & SFML](https://github.com/BenWeiTang/Real-Time-Music-Visualization)
This is a rendition on my [Music Visualization](https://github.com/BenWeiTang/Music-Visualization) project, using C++ and SFML in an attempt to achieve real time pitch detection and visualization of an audio file.

## [(Internship) Galactic Gauntlet | Unity Engine & C#](https://github.com/BenWeiTang/Galactic-Gauntlet-Code-Snippets)
This repo features several code snippets that highlight the work I did on the game Galactic Gauntlet during my CO-OP at Quadratron Games, Philadelphia, PA. Highlight features include [Capture Zone](https://github.com/BenWeiTang/Galactic-Gauntlet-Code-Snippets/tree/main/CaptureZone) and [Procedural Level Generation](https://github.com/BenWeiTang/Galactic-Gauntlet-Code-Snippets/tree/main/ProceduralLevel).

## [Sweeper | Unity Engine & C#](https://github.com/BenWeiTang/Sweeper)
Sweeper is a minesweeper clone made with Unity Engine. Highlight features include [manager class implementation](https://github.com/BenWeiTang/Sweeper/tree/Main/Assets/Scripts/Core/Manager), [gameplay implementation](https://github.com/BenWeiTang/Sweeper/tree/Main/Assets/Scripts/Core/Gameplay), [basic editor scripting](https://github.com/BenWeiTang/Sweeper/tree/Main/Assets/Scripts/Editor), and [experimental ScriptableObject-based animation system](https://github.com/BenWeiTang/Sweeper/tree/Main/Assets/Scripts/Animation).

## [Snatcher | Unity Engine & C#](https://github.com/BenWeiTang/Snatcher)
Snatcher is a 2.5D roguelite game where you play as Snatcher, a frog-like, tiny creature who can steal enemies abilities for its own use to traverse through the environment. Highlight features include [Hierarchical FSM](https://github.com/BenWeiTang/Snatcher/tree/main/Assets/_Snatcher/_Script/Player%20State%20Machine) for the player controller, [ScriptableObjects-based FSM](https://github.com/BenWeiTang/Snatcher/tree/main/Assets/_Snatcher/_Script/Enemy%20State%20Machine) for the enemy AI, and [ScriptableOject-based Event System](https://github.com/BenWeiTang/Snatcher/tree/main/Assets/_Snatcher/_Script/Event%20System) for generic usage.

## [Neural Network | C](https://github.com/BenWeiTang/Neural-Network)
This project features a configurable neural network written in C from scratch.

## [Music Visualization | Processing & SciPy](https://github.com/BenWeiTang/Music-Visualization)
In this project, I converted music (audio files) into images by combining theories, such as color theory and the circle of fifths, and with technologies such as SciPy and Processing.

## [Booking Drexel | JavaScript & Flask & SQLite](https://github.com/BenWeiTang/BookingDrexel)
This joint project features a fake hotel website. I was responsible for the back-end tech stack, including Flask and SQLite, as well as a portion of the front-end, using JavaScript. The domain of the website has expired, but the code remains accessible in this repo.
